## About

STUDIOLOFI was born after the constant hours I spend on my laptop -coding, studying, coding again- and the awful _beep_ sound that the Pomodoro App on my phone had. So I mixed some lofi ambience and resources to make it the perfect study/coding buddy.

Now I just love that my favourite app on the web is made by me ❤

## 🍅Pomodoro

This was the perfect app for including that Pomodoro Component that I made back when I was learning React's basics, *and it has a cute beep sound!!* 🤩


## 📝To do list

Well, as I'm a recicler both in real life and in the virtual world, I included a really helpful to-do list (for lists lovers)

## 🌇Lofi Ambience and music

I included here some lofi playlists for background music 🎶 *disclaimer: I do not own any of these videos or music, and hapilly remove any of them if there's some trouble with copys*

## 🖐Draggable

I included Draggable React Librabry in order to make everything draggable and improve UX

## This will continue...

I'm planning on adding more cool stuff on this app so stay tuned for more!🥰
